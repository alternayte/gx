title: Metric and trace names
---


This page lists every span and instrument. Both the ActivitySource and the Meter are named `Deedbox`.

<!-- snippet: telemetry -->
```cs
// With OpenTelemetry: subscribe to the "Deedbox" ActivitySource and Meter.
//   .WithTracing(t => t.AddSource("Deedbox"))
//   .WithMetrics(m => m.AddMeter("Deedbox"))
const string SourceAndMeter = "Deedbox";
```
<!-- endSnippet -->


## Spans

| Span | Tags |
| --- | --- |
| `deedbox.append`, `deedbox.execute`, `deedbox.load` | `deedbox.stream_type`, `deedbox.stream_id`, `deedbox.events` |
| `deedbox.delete_stream`, `deedbox.erase_stream` | `deedbox.stream_id` |
| `deedbox.batch` | `deedbox.consumer`, `deedbox.from_position`, `deedbox.to_position` |
| `deedbox.handle <consumer>` | `deedbox.consumer`, `deedbox.event_type`, `deedbox.global_position`. Its parent is the append that wrote the event. |
| `deedbox.job` | `deedbox.job.kind`, `deedbox.job.id` |

## Instruments

| Instrument | Unit | Tags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deedbox.append.duration` | ms | `deedbox.stream_type` |
| `deedbox.events.appended` | events | `deedbox.stream_type` |
| `deedbox.append.conflicts` | conflicts | `deedbox.stream_type` |
| `deedbox.execute.retries` | retries | `deedbox.stream_type` |
| `deedbox.counter.duration` | ms | none. Counter wait plus hold time. |
| `deedbox.consumer.lag` | positions | `deedbox.consumer`, `deedbox.schema` |
| `deedbox.consumer.lag.seconds` | s | `deedbox.consumer`, `deedbox.schema` |
| `deedbox.consumer.status` | 0 running, 1 rebuilding, 2 stalled. A retired consumer reports 0. | `deedbox.consumer`, `deedbox.schema` |
| `deedbox.consumer.batch.duration` | ms | `deedbox.consumer` |
| `deedbox.consumer.failures`, `deedbox.consumer.stalls` | count | `deedbox.consumer` |
| `deedbox.jobs` | jobs | `deedbox.job.kind`, `deedbox.job.status` |
| `deedbox.erasure.streams` | streams | none |
| `deedbox.personal_data.decrypts`, `deedbox.personal_data.redactions` | fields | none |

Each instance reports the consumer gauges for the consumers it runs. An instance updates `deedbox.consumer.lag` only after it commits a batch, so the gauge does not grow for a stalled consumer. Alert on the health check and on `deedbox status` instead; see [stalled projection](/operations/stalled-projection/).

## Logs

Log events have stable IDs: 1 to 5 at start-up, 20 to 29 in the runner, and 30 to 34 for jobs. IDs 40 to 45 are for the heartbeat and the cut-over of an inline projection. Every start-up error is a `DeedboxException` with a [DBX code](/reference/errors/).

Events added in 0.5.0:

| ID | Level | Says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | Warning | A new subscription starts at the first event and handles the events that the store already holds; the event gives the count. |
| 29 | Warning | A consumer met a transient database error. The runner runs the batch again and counts no attempt. |
| 42 | Warning | Deedbox did not count this instance as live and refused an append. The instance joins again. |
| 43 | Error | This instance could not join again; it retries. Appends fail with DBX038 until it does. |
| 44 | Warning | A cut-over removed the heartbeat rows of the instances it names, because their heartbeat was late. |
| 45 | Warning | An inline projection cannot finish its catch-up: forced cut-overs ran out of time. |

A stall record and a failed job hold the exception type and stack frames. The exception's message is only in these logs.
