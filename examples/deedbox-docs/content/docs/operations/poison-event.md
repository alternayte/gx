This runbook helps you handle a poison event: an event that makes a handler throw every time.

## What Deedbox has done

1. It retried the event, with growing delays, `HandlerRetries` times.
2. It set the consumer to `stalled` and recorded the event. Other consumers keep running.
3. It retries the event every 5 minutes. When the event succeeds, the consumer runs again without a restart.
4. No event after it was applied, and no event was skipped.

If the cause was outside the handler, such as a service that was down, the consumer runs again at the next retry after the cause is gone.

## Steps

1. Run `deedbox status`. It shows the event ID, event type, stream, version and exception, the attempts so far, and the time of the next retry.
2. Read the stream and the exception. Decide whether the handler, the event or a service it calls is wrong.
3. If the handler is wrong, fix it and deploy. At start-up, a poison stall gets one more round of retries at once, and the consumer moves on once the event succeeds.
4. If the event can never be handled, skip it:

   ```sh
   deedbox skip cart_totals --event 01a0d1cd-e1f2-73f6-9d0b-bd9eec9e61c9 --wait
   ```

   The job checks that this is the event the consumer stalled on, moves the checkpoint one event past it, and records the event and the stall in the jobs table.

The same operations are on the admin API:

<!-- snippet: admin-api -->
```cs
var status = await admin.GetStatusAsync();
foreach (var consumer in status.Consumers)
    Console.WriteLine($"{consumer.Name}: {consumer.Status}, {consumer.Lag} behind");

var rebuild = await admin.RebuildAsync("cart_summary");
var skip = await admin.SkipAsync("cart_totals", stalledEventId);
var job = await admin.GetJobAsync(rebuild);
```
