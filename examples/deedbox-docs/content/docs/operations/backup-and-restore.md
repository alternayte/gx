This runbook explains what to back up and what a restore does to erasures.

## Back up

- The database: the Deedbox schema and your read-model tables, in one backup, so projections and their checkpoints match.
- The master key, outside the database, unless you use database mode. Without it, a restored database has unreadable personal data.

## Erasure and backups

An erasure deletes a subject key from the live database. A backup taken before the erasure still holds that key, so personal data in that backup is readable to anyone with the backup and the master key.

- Keep backups only as long as your privacy duties allow. When the oldest backup from before an erasure ages out, the subject is gone everywhere.
- After you restore an older backup, run every erasure that happened after the backup again. Keep a record of erasures outside the database, for example from the `deedbox.jobs` rows or your own audit log.

## Roll back to an older version

From 0.5.0, Deedbox writes storage format 2 once every instance with a heartbeat row can read it. Versions before 0.5.0 cannot read that data. To go back to an older version after that, restore a backup from before the upgrade. Take one before you deploy 0.5.0.

## Database mode

In database mode, the master key sits in the same backup as the data. A copy of the backup exposes all personal data in it. Move to a key ring or Key Vault before production.
