title: Rebuild a projection
---


This guide shows you how to rebuild a projection after you change its logic.

1. Make sure the projection overrides `ResetAsync`. Without it, the rebuild job fails with [DBX023](/reference/errors/dbx023/).
2. Deploy the new projection code.
3. Queue the rebuild from the CLI:

   ```sh
   deedbox rebuild cart_summary --provider postgres --connection "$DEEDBOX_CONNECTION" --wait
   ```

   Or from code:

   <!-- snippet: admin-api -->
   ```cs
   var status = await admin.GetStatusAsync();
   foreach (var consumer in status.Consumers)
       Console.WriteLine($"{consumer.Name}: {consumer.Status}, {consumer.Lag} behind");

   var rebuild = await admin.RebuildAsync("cart_summary");
   var skip = await admin.SkipAsync("cart_totals", stalledEventId);
   var job = await admin.GetJobAsync(rebuild);
   ```
   <!-- endSnippet -->


## What happens

1. A running app instance takes the job. It calls `ResetAsync` and sets the projection to `rebuilding`, in one transaction.
2. The background runner replays every event from position 0.
3. For an inline projection, appends skip the projection while it rebuilds. When the replay is within one batch of the head, the runner locks the position counter, applies the last events, and sets the projection back to `running`. Appends apply it inline again from then on.
4. For an async projection, the runner sets it back to `running` when it reads to the end.

During the rebuild, the read model is empty or partial. The health check reports `rebuilding` as healthy, so Kubernetes does not restart the app. To keep the old read model serving reads during the change, [replace it without downtime](/how-to/replace-a-read-model/) instead.

If appends arrive faster than the replay, the runner forces the switch after 20 polls without a smaller gap. Appends then wait while it applies the last events, for at most 2 seconds. If it does not reach the head in that time, it keeps what it applied and the projection stays `rebuilding`. After 5 such attempts in a row, the health check reports the projection as degraded, and `deedbox status` says that it cannot finish its catch-up. Make the handlers faster, or run the projection async.

If a handler fails during the replay, the projection stalls on that event, as an async one does. A [skip](/operations/poison-event/) puts an inline projection back to `rebuilding`, so it applies every later event before it runs inline again.
