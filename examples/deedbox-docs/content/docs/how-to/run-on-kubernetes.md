This guide shows you how to run Deedbox with several replicas on Kubernetes.

## Alert on the health check; do not probe with it

<!-- snippet: health-checks -->
```cs
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks().AddDeedboxHealthChecks();
```
<!-- endSnippet -->


The check is unhealthy when a projection or subscription is stalled, or when events wait and its checkpoint has not moved for `StallAfter` (10 minutes by default). A projection that is behind but moving, or rebuilding, is healthy.

A restart does not fix a stall, and neither does taking a pod out of the Service. A subscription stalls when the service it calls is down. With the check on a liveness probe, Kubernetes then restarts every pod in a loop until that service is back. With the check on a readiness probe, every pod leaves the Service and your API is down. So keep the check off both probes, and give it its own path:

<!-- snippet: health-endpoints -->
```cs
// The probes: the process answers. They leave the Deedbox check out.
app.MapHealthChecks("/healthz", new() { Predicate = check => check.Name != "deedbox" });

// For alerts: unhealthy while a projection or subscription is stalled or stuck.
app.MapHealthChecks("/health/deedbox", new() { Predicate = check => check.Name == "deedbox" });
```
<!-- endSnippet -->


```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /healthz, port: 8080 }
readinessProbe:
  httpGet: { path: /healthz, port: 8080 }
```

Point your monitoring at `/health/deedbox` and alert when it is unhealthy. The [stalled projection](/operations/stalled-projection/) and [poison event](/operations/poison-event/) runbooks tell you what to do then.

## Run several replicas

Replicas need no extra setup. Each batch of a projection runs while its replica holds the projection's checkpoint row, so the projections spread across replicas and each runs on one replica at a time.

To keep background work off your web pods, turn the runner off there and run a worker deployment with it on:

<!-- snippet: register-runner -->
```cs
builder.Services.AddDeedbox(es => es
    .UsePostgres(connStr)
    .Stream<Cart>(s => s.Events<ItemAdded, CheckedOut>())
    .Runner(r =>
    {
        r.BatchSize = 500;
        r.MaxPollDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
        r.HandlerRetries = 5;
        r.StallAfter = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
    }));
```
<!-- endSnippet -->


Set `r.Enabled = false` in the web pods.

## Change the schema

Choose one:

- `ApplySchemaOnStartup()`: every pod applies pending migrations under a database lock, so concurrent pods apply them once.
- A Kubernetes Job before the rollout: `deedbox schema apply --provider postgres --connection "$DEEDBOX_CONNECTION"`.

Without either, a pod fails at start-up with the exact fix ([DBX001](/reference/errors/dbx001/)). A newer schema than the build is fine, so old pods keep running during a rolling deploy.

## Keep the master key in a Secret

```yaml
env:
  - name: DEEDBOX_MASTER_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: deedbox, key: master-key }
```

Back the Secret up outside the cluster. Losing every copy of the master key loses all personal data.
