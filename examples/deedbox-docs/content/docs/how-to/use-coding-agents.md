title: Use Deedbox with coding agents
---

This guide shows you how to give a coding agent what it needs to write correct Deedbox code.

## Point the agent at llms.txt

The site publishes the docs as plain Markdown for language models:

- [`/llms.txt`](/llms.txt): an index of every page.
- [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt): every page in one file.
- [`/llms-small.txt`](/llms-small.txt): a shorter version for small context windows.

## Install the agent skill

The repository ships a skill with the rules an agent must follow, such as "decisions are pure" and "never append built-in events".

- Claude Code: copy [`skills/deedbox`](https://github.com/alternayte/deedbox/tree/main/skills/deedbox) to `.claude/skills/deedbox` in your repository.
- Cursor: copy `skills/deedbox/SKILL.md` to `.cursor/rules/deedbox.mdc`.
