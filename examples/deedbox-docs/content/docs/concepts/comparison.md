title: Comparison with other libraries

This page compares Deedbox with other .NET event stores, to help you choose. Each library is good at what it sets out to do; the differences are in scope.

| | Deedbox | Marten | Polecat | Eventuous |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Databases | Postgres, SQL Server | Postgres | SQL Server | Postgres, SQL Server, KurrentDB |
| Scope | Event store only | Document database and event store | Document database and event store | Event store with its own command-service model |
| Your data access | EF Core, Dapper or ADO.NET, in your transaction | Marten sessions | Polecat sessions | Eventuous services |
| Async ordering | One serialized counter; readers never skip | A high-water mark; by design it can skip a gap it judges dead | The same daemon as Marten | See its docs |

Deedbox also encrypts personal data per subject and erases it by deleting the key, and every Deedbox package is MIT-licensed. Check the other projects' docs for their own approach to personal data and for their licence terms; some JasperFx monitoring add-ons need a commercial licence for production use.

## When not to use Deedbox

- You want a document database too. Use Marten or Polecat.
- You need tens of thousands of appends per second to one store. Deedbox serializes appends; see [the benchmarks](/operations/benchmarks/).
- You want KurrentDB (EventStoreDB). Use Eventuous or the KurrentDB client.
