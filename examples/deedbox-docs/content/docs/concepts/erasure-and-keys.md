This page explains how Deedbox encrypts personal data, and what erasure does.

The keys form a chain:

1. The **master key** lives in the database, in a key ring from configuration, or in Azure Key Vault.
2. It wraps one **tenant key** per tenant, which each process unwraps once.
3. Each tenant key wraps the **subject keys** in the `subject_keys` table.
4. Each subject key encrypts that subject's **personal-data fields** in event payloads.

- Each `[PersonalData]` field is encrypted with AES-256-GCM under its subject's key.
- Each subject key is wrapped by its tenant's key. Each tenant key is wrapped by the master key.
- Reads and rebuilds use only local AES. They never call a key service.
- Erasing a subject deletes their key. Every copy of their data, in every stream, becomes unreadable at once.
- The job that finishes an erasure deletes no key. Data written about a subject who comes back uses a new key and stays readable.
- Shredding a tenant destroys the tenant key, all its subject keys and all its pseudonym secrets.

## Pseudonymous subject IDs

The master key also wraps one **pseudonym secret** per tenant and period, in the `pseudonym_keys` table. A secret is a random key. It is not derived from the tenant key, so each can be destroyed on its own.

- `IPseudonyms.SubjectForAsync(identity, periodId)` returns the prefix plus the first 128 bits of HMAC-SHA256(secret, identity), in base32. The same identity and period give the same subject ID on every instance.
- Each period has its own secret, so the same person has a different subject ID in each period.
- Erasure by identity computes the subject ID in every period whose secret still exists, and erases each subject as above.
- Destroying a period's secret makes its subject IDs impossible to link to a person again. The period stays closed.
- Re-wrapping or rotating the master key does not change a secret, so no subject ID changes.
- Reads and rebuilds never use a pseudonym secret.

See [use pseudonymous subject IDs](/how-to/use-pseudonymous-ids/).

## Storage formats

From 0.5.0, Deedbox writes storage format 2 for personal-data fields, subject keys and stored state.

- A format 2 field binds its event ID and its JSON property name. A field copied to another event or property fails with [DBX030](/reference/errors/dbx030/).
- Stored state is sealed with a key derived from the tenant key for one stream, so no single key seals every state of a tenant.
- Deedbox writes format 2 only when every instance with a heartbeat row can read it. While a 0.3 or 0.4 instance runs, appends write format 1, so a rolling deploy works.
- Format 1 stays readable.
- After 0.5.0 writes format 2, an older version cannot read that data. A rollback then needs a [restore](/operations/backup-and-restore/).
- Versions 0.1 and 0.2 write no heartbeat. A rolling deploy straight from one of them to 0.5.0 is not covered for personal data.

## What is safe to rely on

- A missing subject key is the only thing that reads as erased. A key that does not verify, or a master key that cannot unwrap a tenant key, stops Deedbox with an error. A misconfiguration never looks like an erasure.
- Subject keys are cached for one operation only, so an erasure on one instance applies on every instance at once.
- The stored state of a stream with personal data is sealed with a key derived from the tenant key for that stream, and cleared when a subject in it is erased.
- When `EraseSubjectAsync` returns, no load reads the subject's data, on any instance.
- A stall record and a job record hold the exception type and stack frames, never the message. A message can hold personal data, and these rows outlive an erasure.

## What it does not cover

- Backups taken before an erasure keep the subject key until they age out.
- Your projections and subscriptions receive decrypted data. Scrub it when they handle `SubjectErased`.
- Deedbox does not erase outbox rows or your own tables.
- Only top-level properties of an event are encrypted. `[PersonalData]` on a type nested in an event fails start-up ([DBX026](/reference/errors/dbx026/)).
- Metadata, stream IDs and subject IDs are plain text. Use [pseudonymous subject IDs](/how-to/use-pseudonymous-ids/) instead of emails or logins.
- A person who holds a pseudonym secret and a list of candidate identities can re-identify that period's subjects. Pseudonymized data is still personal data under the GDPR.
