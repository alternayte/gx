This page explains the two kinds of handler and the guarantee each one gives.

| | Projection | Subscription |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Writes to | The same database | Anything: email, HTTP, other systems |
| Checkpoint | In the same transaction as its writes | After the handler succeeds |
| Guarantee | Each event's effect happens exactly once | Each event arrives at least once |
| Idempotency key | Not needed | `EventId`, or `StreamId` with `Version` |
| Run modes | Inline or async | Async only |

A projection can promise exactly once because its writes and its checkpoint commit together. A subscription cannot: an email can be sent and the process can die before the checkpoint moves. Pass the event ID on as an idempotency key.

<!-- snippet: subscription -->
```cs
// A subscription does anything outside the database. Delivery is at least once,
// so pass the event ID on as an idempotency key.
public sealed class SendReceipt : Subscription
{
    // Subscriptions are created once; a scoped service comes from ctx.Services instead.
    public SendReceipt(IEmailSender email) =>
        On<CheckedOut>((_, ctx) => email.SendReceipt(ctx.Envelope.StreamId, ctx.Envelope.EventId, ctx.CancellationToken));
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->


## When a handler fails

1. The runner retries the event with growing delays, up to `HandlerRetries` times.
2. Then it sets that consumer to `stalled`, and records the stream, version, event type and exception.
3. Metrics, logs, the health check and `deedbox status` report it.
4. The runner retries the event every 5 minutes, one attempt at a time across all instances. When the event succeeds, the consumer runs again.
5. You fix the cause, or [skip the one event](/operations/poison-event/) with an audited job.

No timeout ever moves a consumer past an event it did not handle.

## Causation and tracing

A subscription's `ctx.Services` is a scope made for the event. A store resolved there appends with the event's tenant and correlation ID, and records the event as the cause. Each handler call runs in a trace span whose parent is the append that wrote the event.
